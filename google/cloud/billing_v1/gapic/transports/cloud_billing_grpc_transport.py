        Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You
        specify the new billing account by setting the ``billing_account_name``
        in the ``ProjectBillingInfo`` resource to the resource name of a billing
        account. Associating a project with an open billing account enables
        billing on the project and allows charges for resource usage. If the
        project already had a billing account, this method changes the billing
        account used for resource usage charges.

        *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the
        transaction history of the GCP Console might be billed to the new
        billing account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing
        account was assigned to the project.

        The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both
        the
        `project <https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo>`__
        and the `billing
        account <https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access>`__.

        You can disable billing on the project by setting the
        ``billing_account_name`` field to empty. This action disassociates the
        current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your
        in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning
        as expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the
        previously associated account. The current authenticated user must be
        either an owner of the project or an owner of the billing account for
        the project.

        Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will
        have much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid
        resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish
        to disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of
        an *open* billing account.
